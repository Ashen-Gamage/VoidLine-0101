The year is 2124.
Humanity no longer lives in the real world. After the NeuroNet Merge, every mind was uploaded into the Voidline — a shared digital consciousness built to last forever.

But something went wrong.

A mysterious signal — tagged only as “0101” — pulsed through the Voidline, fracturing reality and corrupting entire sectors. People are vanishing. Logic is breaking. The line between real and simulated is fading.

You are ZERO, an anomaly born from a failed memory backup. You don’t belong. You aren’t supposed to exist. But in this broken world, that makes you humanity’s last hope.

Your mission:
🧠 Dive deep into the corrupted Voidline.
Trace the origin of the 0101 Signal.
And decide — reboot the system, or burn it all down.

💡 Game World Elements:
🧬 Glitchy, digital landscapes that evolve and shift (procedurally generated?)

👾 Rogue AIs, memory ghosts, and code beasts

🧠 Memory pickups to restore past fragments of who you were

🔓 Hacking nodes, puzzle gates, and platforming challenges

🧪 Optional Features You Could Add:
Multiple endings based on choices ("Save Voidline", "Reboot", or "Escape")

A code-based puzzle system to unlock areas or manipulate time

Health = Stability, and if it hits zero, you "desync" and reboot
